Remarks after initial commit:

* no .gitignore file - DONE
* no description (.md) file - DONE
* path to webriver is hardcoded - DONE
* webdriver executable is for Windows OS only
* pom.xml file is not configured to run tests from command line - DONE
* no HTML report for result - DONE
* all internal logic is open: all elements and methods on pages are public - DONE
* most of logic is located inside tests, but it would be better to have logic inside pages classes - DONE
